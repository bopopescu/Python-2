# A string is just text in python. Example my name is WIll
# Unlike other programming lanuages were we have to assign varables as a string in python we just assgin the text to a variable (See below)

Name = 'Will'
print(Name)
# Strings can be used in Single quotes or double quotes.

#Raw Strings
    # When we want to ignore escape characters in a string we use raw strings.

Original = ('That is Carol\'s cat.')
print(Original)
# Prints including the escape character

RawS = (r'That is Carol\'s cat.')
print(RawS)
# Prints ingoring  the escape character
