Now, to make HTTP requests in python, we can use several HTTP libraries like:
httplib
urllib
requests

The response of a GET request often has some valuable information, known as a payload, in the message body.
Using the attributes and methods of Response, you can view the payload in a variety of different formats.

Headers
The response headers can give you useful information, such as the content type of the response payload and a time limit on how long to cache the response.
To view these headers, access .headers:
